We got to go in and select the beer of our choice from shelves and shelves of single bottles, everything from Bud to Hoegaarden to Chimay and back again.  So many beers I've never even heard of.\\n\\nAnyway, they have hot dogs too...soooo many choices.  I came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings.  I had the veggie dog with cheese, tomatoes and dill pickles, and it was so so yummy.  Everyone else was thrilled with their dogs as well.  We also got cheese fries with ranch dipping sauce, fried zucchini, and onion rings...and heart attacks...just kidding, but damn what a greasy meal of awesomeness!\",\n",

My sister suggested we go because she had gone long ago when in High School and had a blast... that alone made me a bit wary of the place. High School... blech! Anyway, despite hitting my head on the table behind me when I first sat down (because I'm a big klutz) I ended up having the BEST time. I truly believe this show is what you make of it... so let your inhibitions go and be a big kid! I did and had a rockin' time. My sister, boyfriend and I stuffed our faces with all the food, pounded the tables and yelled at the top of our lungs the entire time. Our King didn't win but they were all a lot of fun to watch. Psst... Norway and France... get back at me!!! hahahaha...\",\n",

So bitter I would have to dump a quarter cup of cream and several heaping tablespoons of sugar into this cup-a-joe to overpower the flavor...  but at that point, why wouldn't I go all out and find myself a milkshake or some other creamy sugary treat?  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least you'll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one.\",\n",

The decor is classy, and most people dressed fairly nicely.  A family or two, but by in large an all adult crowd. Our waiter was informative and fun without being overbearing.  He even brought us tasters of the turtle soup because we were both anxious, but hesitant, to try it.  I started with the gumbo- spicey, and rich!  Definatley try it but beware that it's very filling.  My date started with the alligator.  Tender and delicious- breaded, a bit like calamari.  Entrees  were beautifully presented and flavorful. I ordered the crab cakes- divine!!!!!!  Unlike other places, the crab cakes here are HUGE and ALL CRAB.  They are 96% crab and the rest a bit of veggie compot to hold them together. No breading/fying gets in the way of the fresh, delectable crab meat.  My only mistake was ordering the entree portion (2)... one was PLENTY.  Dessert -their specialty bread pudding souflee and chicory coffee- was outstanding!  To top off the expirience, you can take a candy praline on the way out.  Highly recommended!\\n\\nUpdate:  Sad, but true, CP has temporarily closed it's doors because it is moving from the Aladdin/Planet Hollywood to another location on the strip.

       " 'People who know me know that there is little in this life that makes me happier than a little fro-yo.  Even just saying \"fro-yo\" perks me up a bit.  And in Toronto, where there is a wealth of ice cream and gelato (YES) shops, it\\'s nice to see fro-yo get a little more attention.\\n\\nCe Fiore follows the business model of the fancier upscale yogurt shop.  If you\\'re familiar with the California-based chain Pinkberry (or its many imitators), you will know what I mean.  It is less diet-worship-y than Tasti-D-Lite and a little more slick than your Yogen Fruz.  It\\'s a yogurt shop for people who love frozen yogurt for what it is, not as some sort of basterdized version of low-cal ice cream. And unlike Yogen Fruz, they don\\'t tout \"probiotics\" as if the only reason one would eat ice cream is for its inevitable effect on your GI tract.\\n\\nCe Fiore has a beautiful, shiny, glossy interior with sleek clean surfaces and sleek modern furnishings - it\\'s like if you could walk inside of an iPod...which served you delicious frozen yogurt.  Let\\'s hope its high-traffic Annex location won\\'t strip it of its charms too quickly.  The easiest way to get there from transit is to take the Bloor line to Spadina Station and exit out of the Walmer side exit as opposed to the main Spadina exit.  When you get to the doors you will literally be gazing upon its glory.\\n\\nOK, let\\'s talk fro-yo. At Ce Fiore, they have four varieties: original, green tea (matcha), acai berry and raspberry-pomegranate.  All three \"flavored\" yogurts serve as a souped up version of the creamy, tangy original yogurt.  Raspberry-pomegranate is the sweetest, with a fruity tang and a floral scent.  Acai is a little milder of a flavor with a hint of berry and a lovely pale color.  If you aren\\'t sure which flavor to try, the staff is very friendly and generous with samples.\\n\\nNext, toppings.  Wow, they have a lot.  My go-to fruit topping on frozen yogurt is always pineapple.  Last time I went to Ce Fiore (not long before they closed), they were out of pineapple.  And what good fortune, because for once I actually seriously considered the other choices - they have many kinds of fresh fruit, as well as candy toppings like gummi bears, as well as a couple of syrup-type toppings.  I chose pomegranate kernels to go on my Acai berry yogurt.  Pomegranate on frozen yogurt is amazing!  The little juice pods get cold and delicious without getting chewy or hard.  Tasty. \\n\\nThe yogurt isn\\'t too cheap, but reasonably-priced for its quality and considering the similar cost of nearby frozen treats such as Greg\\'s.  A small yogurt with one topping will run about $4.  If you want cheap, hit up the Metro and buy a pint of store brand.  Even the Baskin Robbins will run these prices.',\n",

       " 'When I first moved out to Middleton I split my grocery-shopping between the two aged Sentry and Kohl\\'s stores, neither of which were altogether satisfactory but was still slightly better than driving to Woodman\\'s and fighting the crowds.  When Kohl\\'s became Copps not much changed, until one day I learned the store was closing and reopening in the Frank Lloyd Wright development further up Century.  About a month after the store opened I visited it for the first time, and I was highly impressed.  The layout is much more user-friendly and modern.  I especially like how the produce and deli sections come together, so you quickly can pick up meals-to-go and hit the salad bar right after walking in.  Another nice feature of the aisle layout is the \"Natural & Organic\" shelves.  In each section there is shelf space devoted to the natural and organic varieties, which makes them much easier to find then when everything is by brand.  I\\'ve recently found myself utilizing the self-checkouts when I am only buying a few items, and it is incredibly convenient.  I used to wait until I was out of just about everything to go to the store, but now I\\'m in and out in five minutes flat.  I can\\'t believe I never did this before.\\n\\nI especially enjoy the organic produce being the first thing you see as you come in the doors.  The Farmers Market is great, but if you just need a tomato or an onion they\\'re right there.  The deli and the salad bar are always reliable, though I tend to get off work fairly l late and selections can get picked over.  Just last night I discovered they sell sushi boxes, and I thought mine was very good - though the single soy sauce packet wasn\\'t quite enough.  The check-out staff have always been quick and friendly, and once when an item slipped out of the bag at the counter the bagger chased me out to my car to return it to me.\\n\\nThe drawbacks of the store are that the prices are generally higher than Woodman\\'s and the selection can be a bit sparse.  I almost always find what I need, but there is always one item that is either no longer stocked or out of stock when I\\'m there, which can be really frustrating.  There used to be a bit of a wait for check-out but now with the self-checkouts this isn\\'t much of a problem.  I also found that it is best not to go shopping on Sunday nights since much more seems to be out of stock.  Also, the parking lot can get a bit hectic especially on weekends.  Overall there\\'s not much to dislike about the place, and it serves as a great anchor for the entire commercial development there.',\n",

I was covered in the end, but it was an ordeal.  When I picked up my car, I talked to the manager and told her, and she said she suspected it was a guy they had just let go.  Unfortunately, the police did nothing other than take a report, even though I told them Falconi's knew who stole the cards.  It was my bad for leaving it in my car, but you'd think your personal belongings are safe when you bring your car in for a major repair like that.

WHAT????  that's equivalent to going to the golden arches, and not able to order and cold and sugary icey coca-cola to wash my big mac down.   above all....minus the coffee and the service, this restaurant has a lot going for it, compared to the earlier mentioned pho houses on this side of town, my ass will be plopped here a lot more often after that tasty bowl of pho\",\n",

Out of all of the places we looked, only two, Ashley\\'s and The Roomstore, had furniture that grabbed my Mom\\'s attention, but the prices were too high, plus delivery in 8 to 10 weeks was not what we needed to hear.  At Pruitt, we found a bed, furniture set, plus a mattress set that we were happy with.  The only set-back was that, while the bed and the larger furniture items were set to arrive at our home the next week, it would be another month before the two sidetables could join the rest.  I also had to make the first call to inquire about the delivery delay- we were told that we\\'d hear from them in a month\\'s time, and yet more than a month had passed and no one called.

Not here.\\n- Not as crowded as the big strip casinos so you will never wait in a one hour line to check in or out, or for anything else.  \\n- Easy access to the other downtown casinos, so you can stay here and gamble at the more luxurious Golden Nugget quite easily.\\n- Lots of oldtimers with more interesting stories than the twenty something boneheads on the strip who think it's SO COOL to drop $300 on their very own VIP table at a jerkoff nightclub where they can sit and whine about how long it takes to get an overpriced cocktail.\\n- If it's your thing, there's plenty of working girls on nights Thursday through the weekend.  Very easy to spot.  Find a slot machine in a corner with a view of the main room and just keep your eyes open for 20 minutes.  But for god sakes man use a condom even for just a BJ.\\n- Probly worth a visit just for the ancient sign which is the same one Bugsy Siegel had installed when he owned the place in the 40s.

Presentation was excellent- small, brightly colored pickled vegetables with a GIANT serving or pate. Also served with warm bread. The pate wasn't as rich as I'd hoped, nor as decadent. It did have a nice smoky flavor though.  Onto the DB Burger. Don't be deceived by it's relatively small size. The burger melts in your mouth, with all the delicious richness that you'd expect from foie, short ribs and premium beef at once. I finished only half. The burger was divine! The fries were disappointing- neither crispy nor firm,  they were a bit mushy and lacking any flavor. Dessert was two scoops of homemade rocky road, and dark roast coffee with a complementary chocolate. \\n\\nUltimately, it was a good all around experience. Service was efficient, etc. With all the unique and inspired restaurants in Las Vegas though, I doubt I'll revisit.

I then presented the coupon to the cashier (who I believe was the owner) and asked for the 10% discount. He quite rudely told me \"No. 10% is only for dinner. You only get the two dollar discount.\" There was no mention of dinner on the coupon, but I didn\\'t argue with him for even a second. I just told him, \"Ok, that\\'s fine, we\\'ll accept the two dollar discount. But just so you know, you should probably change your coupon because the way it\\'s worded you make it sound like we could get 10% off of lunch.\" \\n\\nI was telling him, politely, that we weren\\'t even going to argue about what discount we should get; just, \"FYI dude, your coupon\\'s a bit confusing.\" Rather than just moving on, the cashier proceeded to argue with me, repeating what he\\'d said earlier. I told him again, we were fine with just the two dollar discount and that my only point was that his coupon was unclear and that\\'s why I had requested the 10% discount. This fell on deaf ears. \\n\\nWe got the last laugh. After accepting my stupid two dollar discount, I withheld what would have been my 15% tip from these idiots and got my ten percent discount after all, and then some.

Who am I to question the dining habits of Midwesterners?  I found a description of the place in one of the Madison free magazines designed for tourists, which focused on independent restaurants, and it sounded like a fun dive, so we went.\\n\\nNow, a word of advice.  Don\\'t go out to dinner on a game day in the state capital when the Badgers have beaten Michigan State to a place that has been around since the Eisenhower administration, where grandfathers who are WU alums bring their grandkids after the game.  Don\\'t do it.  This isn\\'t a small place, but it was beyond packed when we got there, and we had to wait for close to an hour.  Football photos and tacky christmas lights, whorehouse-red lighting and red naugahyde covering most surfaces might give you an idea of the ambience, described in the magazine I referred to above as \"delightfully tacky\".  I don\\'t know how delightful it was, but it was tacky.  And crowded.  And loud.  And so we waited.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks at the bar to while away the time.  Peter ordered  a local microbrew, and I was served the best Bloody Mary I ever had in my life, which comes standard with a small PBR chaser.  Both drinks came to $8.50, which, to my NYC perspective, made it a hell of a deal.  Get a load of what garnishes went into my drink:\\n\\nOne celery stalk\\nTwo huge pimiento stuffed green olives\\nTwo pickled asparagus spears\\nThree pickled string beans\\nOne garlic pickle spear\\nThree pickled Brussel Sprouts  \\n\\nGarnishes notwithstanding, it was really delicious.  The garnishes just made it more so.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the meal, there were highs and lows, heavier on the lows, and glimmers of what could indicate a good meal on a less busy day.  All tables get a relish tray of radishes, carrot sticks and scallions.  Not really sure why the scallions were there.  The breadbasket was horrible.  There were small melba toasts in it, thankfully, but other than being warm, the bread itself had zero to recommend it, other than being a place to put butter.  Peter ordered a decent shrimp cocktail for $10.\\n\\nEntrees come with salad, soup and a veg or potato.  We both ordered the special of the day, prime rib, with Peter opting for the King cut ($28) and me opting for the Queen ($22).  I love prime rib, and was looking forward to it.  Peter also ordered sides of sauteed onions and mushrooms ($3 each).\\n\\nThe salad was fair, fresh, and not bad, but the dressings offered were pretty sweet and not very tasty. The signature dressing is French with Roquefort in it.  DON\\'T try it.  I did, and the salad went right back. The soup of the day was cream of chicken.  Normally, that sets the alarm bells off in my head, but instead of a gluey starchy gloppy sludge, I got a well-balanced, soupy soup with delicious chunks of tender chicken and a chickeny base.   The signature potato is a hash brown loaf of sorts which has a nice crispy outside but it basically bland and underseasoned shredded frozen potato underneath.  Not terrible, but not worth eating.  \\n\\nNow...for the prime rib.  We ordered ours medium rare.  The first dishes to come out looked gray.  When we cut into ours, there was no pink apparent.  One bite and we sent them back.  Peter\\'s second piece of meat was textbook medium rare, and the single largest piece of beef I have ever seen served to one person.  He said it was delicious.  Mine, on the other had, was virtually raw, full of fat and gristle, and was inedible.  Sent it back again.  The third time out, I was so annoyed that when I tried to cut into it and could not get my serrated steak knife through it, I gave up.  That was three steaks I had been served, and not one was as ordered or edible.  I\\'m not that demanding--I would have settled for an overcooked steak at that point, but it was not to be.  As it was, the steak Peter had was very good, and on that note, I am giving Smoky\\'s two stars.  Several tables around us were also sending back meat, so I am assuming the kitchen  was simply overwhelmed by the volume, although it isn\\'t like this is the first football game day ever to come to Madison.  \\n\\nOur server was excellent and patient, and the soup and cocktail both indicated that this might indeed be a serviceable restaurant when they have time to prepare the food properly.  I don\\'t know when I\\'ll be in Madison again, but if I did go back and was taken to Smoky\\'s, I will make sure not to go on a Saturday during football season.',\n",

The server was really good, she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.  The wings are a must have when you visit.  My favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.  They are baked and then grilled, so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively...  The garlic parm wings are also great and I suggest you definitely try these as well.  I also ordered the steak and egg \"headwich\" which is  definitely as big as my head.  It was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.  And, to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers, wings, steaks, and eggs weren\\'t enough we also tried one of the desserts (cheesecake) which was a little better than average.

The Prosciutto e Melone and XXX martinis were good but not spectacular, but we both thought that the Anastasia (vodka, basil, and muddled strawberries) and the Blueberry Lemon Drop (with fresh blueberries) were distinctive and delicious.

So check.\\nBut maybe the next time we go it\\'ll taste like rat jerky and the service will suck? \\nThe croissant was buttery heaven, the soup was full of flavor, the strawberries were ruby red gems of sweetness and the meal was so big we had it for lunch and dinner! I think that\\'s check and mate, good sir.\\nGah! Yeah, but we\\'ve Only. Been. Once. Is any of this getting through to you?\\nUh, fine you panty-waisted pansy. Post your disclaimer. You just gave me reason to rave even harder.   ...douche.)\\n\\nIt\\'s very reminiscent of Miracle Mile in the way it\\'s arranged, with cafeteria style seating and a queue (I just wanted to use that word) where you order, file through, pay for your meal and wait for them to call your magic number or bring it to your table.  \\n\\nFirst, the menu is massive with everything from fancy potatoes and pasta dishes to muffalettas and \"slimwiches.\" There are to-go menus hanging out by the door so you can take your time wavering between the po\\'boy and the panini before you even get close to the guy that takes your order, a refreshing change compared to the hustle and bustle, \"Move along cattle!\" type treatment you get at Miracle Mile. They have a ginormous all-you-can-eat salad bar off to the side with deli salads (potato, pasta, fruit, etcetera), gingerbread muffins and tons of organic veggies. I won\\'t lie. It was tempting. The prices are also way reasonable compared to Miracle Mile, with gargantuan sandwiches, big dressed potatoes and plentiful salads between six and seven bucks. Seriously, nothing on the menu is over seven bucks except for the muffalettas (which are fun to say, but I only have a vague idea what the heck they are).\\n\\nGo with the Manager\\'s Half Sandwich Deal. Just trust me on this. It\\'s 6.79 and is half a sandwich (muffs excluded, but they have their own quarter meal deal for 6.99) and your choice of soup, fruit or a side salad. One sneaky little surprise, if the sandwich on the menu says it comes with chips, a pickle, veggies, fruit, whatever (and most of them do), you still get that item in addition to your choice of side! It\\'s a mountain of food, and the half sandwich resembles what a full sandwich would at regular delis (Fancy Pants Mile excluded).\\n\\nI had the California Club, which came with turkey, guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a buttery, flaky croissant. It was the things dreams are made of. The Texas chili was pretty good, but Mr. Man\\'s tomato basil soup was rockin\\', and the fresh fruit was sweet and delicious.\\n\\nAnd when you leave, feel free to wander up to the register and help yourself to to-go box (you\\'re probably going to need it) and a super sturdy plastic to-go cup. Seriously. This is my new office cup. It\\'s as sturdy if not sturdier as any cheap plastic ware you\\'d buy from Target. \\n\\nYeah, it\\'s official. This place is the bee\\'s knees.',\n",

We had some friends who worked their connections to get our group in for free, but we were the lucky ones. The usual $20-25 cover charge and long line make going to this (and any vegas club) daunting. I could drink at the hotel bar with no cover charge and probably have a better time.\\n\\nSecond is the crowd. Tao takes up two floors -- first floor is the traditional night club with multiple rooms containing bars and dance floors. We decided to opt out of buying bottle service and because we didn\\'t, we were stuck with fighting through the crowds. Forget dancing... You would need space for that and apparently space is only given to those who can afford bottle service. \\n\\nThe second floor is the \"Tao Beach\" which is basically the roof deck with outdoor lounging areas, pool and bar. It was our preferred location because it was less crowded, but because it was still 100+ degrees in the evening... it wasn\\'t the most ideal place to hang out. \\n\\nOverall, the music was so-so, the crowd was eh, and the place is not one i would vote to visit again.',\n",

       " 'A final stop for last call after enjoying a late night tapas, I was surprised by how small this place is compared to the other lounges/bars in oversized spaces Arizona. I found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly. \\n\\nYou have a hostess area right when you enter. I checked out the lounge to the right and it had about three or four major seating areas along with some tables-but the people sitting there looked way comfortable and they weren\\'t about to leave anytime soon.\\n\\nWe went to the left and there were high tables and stools set up. Along the wall were large cushioned backs for loungers on the plush cushion. I opted for the stool and it was surprisingly fine-most stools for shorties make me feel weird since my feet are dangling. The rest of the space had more high tables and then a smaller bar area with stools. There was plenty of seating, and while it wasn\\'t packed, everyone there looked like they were with friends or established dates and totally relaxed having drinks-I didn\\'t feel any meat market here.\\n\\nI was disappointed by the wine by the glass selection (not the highest caliber-hence the minus start) so I stuck with the martini selection. Most \\'tinis don\\'t go under 7.50 but they also don\\'t go over 10-pretty reasonable. The waiter was very down to earth and told me the truth about buying cigarettes-that the bar down the street would have them and be like 7.50-no thanks! So mad props to him for the low down.\\n\\nWe got the Summer Peach, the S\\'mores, Afternoon Delight, and Raspberry \"\" (blanking out on drink name-sorry!). They fill their drinks to the brim and they are pretty damn strong. The peach one was refreshing and not overtly sweet-much like a belletini. The raspberry was like a popsicle...an ADULT popsicle-a bit too sweet for me but had real raspberries on the bottom. The afternoon was a personal favourite of mine-citrusy but not too sweet, I\\'ll def. get this drink next time. The s\\'mores was out of control-graham cracker crust? An actual marshmellow in it? Whoa. It was delcious for a sip, but not sure I could get a whole one of those thangs...\\n\\nOverall, the vibe is very relaxed, clubby but not in your face and def. not a meat-market.

I was cooking and the seal on the bottom came loose and the bottom began to pop off. Literally made 3 distinct pops and then a strange sound just before I took it off the heat thinking it was going to blow. \\n\\nSo I sent an email to All-Clad explaining what had happened to the pan and that I did not have a warantee nor the original box, but was it replaceable anyway. It took about 3 months for them to get back to me with instructions on how & where to return it. So I did. About 3 months after I received their email. \\n\\nI really didn\\'t think that I was going to get any response other than \"Dear M, we\\'re sorry but......\" \\n\\nToday Fed-Ex delivers me a BRAND NEW 10\" saute pan with a brand new lid included (which I did not include the old one when I sent the pan back)!! \\n\\nI am so pleasantly surprised. It was so unexpected. And SO fast. I only sent it about 3 weeks ago. \\n\\nThis clearly a company that stands behind its products. That is pretty rare these days. So...I just HAD to YELP about it to let others know that though fairly expensive, All-Clad cookware is not only great cookware, but the company is great too and well worth paying for. They stand behind their products and replace them when they break sooner than the time it takes to get through a millenium.

My husband and I are big fans of places where we can sit outside, have a few glasses of beer, and catch up since during the week we are occasionally too busy to really see each other much.  The other great thing is the cross section of people Casey's attracts...undergrads, grad students, professors, young professionals like myself, and other folks who live in or around the neighborhood.\\n\\nService has always been friendly and prompt each time we've been there, whether it be a Friday afternoon at happy hour or a Wednesday or Thursday night at 10 pm.

The beef was real steak slices, not that overcooked brittle things of Panda\\'s \\'Beijing Beef\", and it was covered in sauce and green onions over rice. \\n\\nThey have soy and red chili on the tables, not only in packets that you have to beg for at P.E. They also have Arizona Ice Teas and Yeo\\'s Soymilk, try finding that at P.E.!

Granted, November is still usually a little early for snow, but looking at the weather forecast a week before the conference and seeing at least 3 days of snow did not exactly make my day!\\n\\nBooking my stay at the Westin Convention Center however, made things SO much easier.  They've got a covered sky-bridge directly connecting to the convention center from the 2nd floor.  No need to even put on a heavy jacket to go to your conference.

So many full service hotels are charging for this these days and it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine to pay for a more expensive hotel and then to pay for Internet access on top of that.\\n\\nMy issue with my hotel room (don't know if it is true for all) was noise.  I was close to the elevator, but the door seemed particularly thin as I often heard people walking back and forth down the hall and talking.  I was also able to hear various building noises like running water, etc.  The walls between rooms seemed to be thick enough because I didn't hear other people talking or their TVs (or maybe there just weren't people staying in the rooms to either side).\\n\\nI enjoyed their room service breakfast menu.  They had a nice offering of healthy alternatives including granola, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.  Delivery times were pretty spot on and the attendants were friendly and efficient.\\n\\nAnother big plus for the hotel is that it is connected to the Original Fish Market.

I first stumbled upon this place two weeks after they opened and have consistently enjoyed the dining experience (about 8 times in total). The last time I was there was a week ago.\\n\\nRestaurant / Decor:\\nAs you approach Red Square, two things will stand out, one, a huge statue of Lenin that looks like it has lived there for 50 years with all the trappings of pigeon minus the head and a large Russian stylized casement window to a freezer that holds some of the most exotic vodkas on the market today. The decor has changed some since the first year of operation to help accommodate their popularity but it has not significantly taken away from the overall experience. The furniture is all antiqued and the walls are designed as if it is pealing back decades of propaganda. The lush red velvet curtains and huge chandeliers makes it out to be a place where the Kremlin elite would come to have a drink with less than subtle hints of it's past as maybe a church or where Bolshevik revolutionaries might have hung out. The restaurant is very clean. Relatively accessible within Mandalay Bay Casio (casino's are hard to navigate in general). Though it has little online presence. \\n\\nSpecialty / Favorites:\\nThe drinks!  They host the largest selection of vodka's I have ever experienced and I love vodka. I have been exposed to new vodka's for the first time there by ordering tasting flights (explained below). They also have an awesome selection of cocktails from savory to sweet, all worth tasting. \\n\\nFood / Drink:\\nThey have had good consistency for many years though I would be remise if I did not say this last time was not as good as past dining experiences there.  \\n\\nThere menu is relatively consistent with a few changes here and there though I am not sure if it is seasonal or otherwise.  \\n\\nFor starters the Steak Tartare (raw beef, onion, capers, dijon mustard-anchovy sauce, creme fraiche, with melba toast) is fabulous, prepared at the table and good to the last bite. The Lobster Bisque has not been consistent and I have been disappointed with it, though the Chilled Lobster Salad (with cold lobster, tomatoes, baby greens, basil oil and lemon creme fraiche) was really awesome though I think it is a seasonal dish since I did not see in on the menu this time. I personally always order Caviar Smothered Blini (a large Russian blini smothered in creme fraiche, American sturgeon caviar and herbed beurre blanc, a potato pancake with caviar and a creamy sauce).  \\n\\nAs for the entrees, the classics are all very solid; Chicken Kiev (stuffed with herbs, cheese and butter, served with vegetable rice pilaf and a mushroom and port reduction) and Seared Ahi Tuna (warm Yukon potato salad and chilled asparagus in a spicy tomato dipping sauce) are awesome; the Stroganoff, Roquefort Filet Mignon (potato pure with roasted garlic and red wine sauce) and Salmon Kulebyaka (salmon seared with dill on a puff pastry with a dill saffron buerre blanc) are also favorites, though I don't like Salmon all that much so it is a shared opinion. \\n\\nDeserts... The chocolate cake was really good. Sorry, I am normally not very sober by this time.\\n\\nBut the real reason to go eat at the Red Square is to drink at the Red Square. It is truly all about the vodka. I love vodka. It is one of my favorite alcohols and they offer something here that I had never seen before, Vodka Flights. You can choose from several Vodka Flights, based by geography, ie, American or Russian, by flavorings, potato vodkas or exotic vodkas, etc. You get 4 shots served in a red block of ice. To best describe this you have to imagine a bright red cube of ice with 4 holes for the shot glasses, it is like nothing I have ever experience before. But if raw vodka doesn't float your boat, there are 3 pages of fabulous cocktails that are honestly some of the best drinks I have ever had. The showmanship at the bar is worth ordering five or six alone. \\n\\nService:\\nThis is not 5 five star dining though there is a real attempt to be very professional and take the extra steps to make sure you have all that you need as you would find in a more formal environment. I have found the staff to be attentive, especially with water, which helps with the impending hangover. The wait staff's description of the menu offerings have been accurate and their opinions helpful. \\n\\nHospitality:\\nThe staff is all very friendly and welcoming. There seems to be a pride in their work and most of the wait staff has a passion for food. I have never felt stupid asking a question about the menu.\\n\\nValue (price vs. overall experience):\\nSetting expectations is very important. As experience has taught me, there is no such thing as value in Las Vegas.

Someone was assigned to \"watch me\" for almost 2 hours before the manager took the time to talk to me.  He told me that the best he could do was charge me $450.  Since there six people in my party, I decided to sign so we could leave.  It was almost 5 am at that point.\\n\\nI very calmly attempted to inform them that we were not satisfied with our accommodations and that we were being over charged.  Since it was in a club, I had a hard time hearing them.  I asked if I could talk to him outside and he refused to talk to me outside of the club.  Their initial response was to threaten to call police on me and that I would have to wait 3 hours to wait for them to get there.  \\n\\nFrom what I learned from talking to three different club security employees that the 40 40 club scams people to get them into the club and getting their credit cards, then overcharges them at the end of the night because they think people will be too drunk to notice.

That is a problem, because when you come in, you\\'re just about smacked in the face by the menu, which is up on a wall.  Not above the counter, but right in front of you - the counter is off to the side.

Strike one.\\n\\nThe staff is helpful - they offer to hand you a menu - but as with many places where you order at a counter, looking through a menu in your hands with people waiting isn\\'t a great idea.

But if you can do the math, that\\'s seating for 24 people, shared between Bojangles and Donatos.  Add to that the fact that service is not fast - it took upwards of ten minutes to get my sub, and others who ordered before I did took even longer.  Strike three.\\n\\nAs to the food: It wasn\\'t bad.  My sandwich was not huge - think a large ciabatta bun from Jack-in-the-Box, with a reasonable amount of meat and toppings.  The only problem is that I ordered it without lettuce, and it came with lettuce, as well as a monstrous dollop of mayo, most of which was removed when I removed the lettuce.  But the flavor wasn\\'t bad.  The pizzas looked okay, if a bit on the thin side.  I also had a cookie, which was okay but for a crust that tasted a bit burnt.\\n\\nThe staff was helpful, except for being a bit on the slow side - since they were overstaffed and the oven-cooking took so long, they could probably cut back.  And since the credit card machine spit out a receipt that prompts for tips, it ticked me off a bit.  Also, pre-made salads in the cooler is a bit off-putting.  Pizzas and subs are definitely the way to go here.',\n",

They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.  The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.\\n\\nAfter the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.

       " 'quince, located in the Grand Pacific Junction shopping district of Olmsted Falls, brings a bit of food whimsy to the area.  The dining room has retained the slightly-colonial decor from previous restaurants, giving it an uncluttered but homey atmosphere.  The wine list is not extensive but does provide some good selections.  \\n\\nWe started with the calimari in Thai sweet chili sauce with soba noodles.  The noodles were flash-fried and delivered in a stiff rectangle of what looked like a collapsed wicker chair.  They were a bit odd but quite tasty.  The spinach salad with coconut chicken was fantastic, but be warned: it\\'s large enough to be a meal, and my husband had only a couple bites of his steak because he was so full from the salad.\\n\\nI had the bacon and horseradish-wrapped pork, which arrived on an oblong platter almost two feet long. It was delicious, but at a crowded table the platter could become a bit awkward to negotiate.  The pork was accompanied by mashed potato balls that were fried crispy on the outside and sauteed onion and zucchini that formed the bed on which the pork medallions and potato balls rested.  It was all very good.\\n\\nAnother person in our party had the spinach gnocchi, which was homemade and quite delicious, the gnocchi had terrific texture and the sauce was very tasty.  My husband\\'s steak was the most disappointing entre of the evening.  It came with a horseradish and bacon topping and bleu cheese - it was the strangest presentation of bleu cheese I\\'d ever seen, being a half-inch thick rectangle of sort of plunked on top of the steak like an afterthought.  The steak itself was very tasty, though.\\n\\nThe chef is apparently a big fan of bacon.  There are many bacon-wrapped choices on the menu, and the specials included at least one additional bacon-wrapped choice.  Now, I never regard bacon as a bad thing, but it\\'s good to know the \"lay of the land.\"\\n\\nThe only ding I have is the speed at which food came out of the kitchen.  I have no idea what exactly was going on in the kitchen, but for a long time *nothing* came out of there, and then there were sudden spurts of dishes all coming out at once.  Everything was still hot and fresh when it arrived at our table, so it obviously wasn\\'t just sitting on a sideboard, but we were a bit pressed for time.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and it was probably just a one-time thing, but I can\\'t quite give it five stars under the circumstances.  Still, it was quite tasty.',\n",

No more \"sketchy\" than many pockets throughout central Phoenix. So it\\'s not Chandler or Surprise? Get over it. I rather relish any hints of urban grit.

In fact, it\\'s probably one of the most genuine Middle-Eastern establishments you\\'ll find in Phoenix. From their baba ghanoush and falafel to their tabouli and lamb kebabs, the food tastes fresh, and frankly, like it should.\\n\\nNothing on the menu is priced unreasonably.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this deli located in another part of town.  I immediately park in the automotive packed traffic jungle that is murray ave. on a weekend and head over.  I pass a subway restaurant that is jam packed with folks jamming down $5 footlongs with maybe the best deli in pittsburgh literally two doors down.  I\\'m assuming this one is pretty much the same as the one in the strip meaning it\\'s basically a take out place with a couple hightops, but not meant for sit down meals.  It already has a plus than the original because this one is open today (Sunday).  I walk in and their are the coolers to my left with lots of great deli meats and specialty cheeses and a counter straight ahead where to place my order.  The menu items are posted on a chalkboard above the counter.  I order a hot pastrami signature sandwich served on rye with dark mustard, a cup of matzah ball soup and a scoop of chicken liver (I know, I most likely jewish in a former life... Don\\'t get me started on lox).  I look to my right and to my surprise there is ample booth and table seating with a couple of TV\\'s with NFL on.  Awesome, I can actually sit down read the paper and watch tv... Then, I see something that is another revelation.  They have a cooler full of bottles of beer and a sign that says something to the effect of help yourself... Now, this is getting good I can even have a beer with lunch.  This is much better than the original location.  The waitress brings my food in less than 5 minutes.  The matzah soup is piping hot with a delicious broth and a softball sized matzah ball.  The soup is a hit.  The sandwich is fantastic.  The rye bread is great quality and the dark mustard rich and flavorful.  The pastrami is warm and packed with tons of flavor.  It\\'s a big sandwich, but not so big that I need to use a knife and fork.  They have like a super signature sandwich that has over a lb. of meat, but that would violate my dont\\' eat anything as big as your head rule.  It does have a bit of gristle on it, but that\\'s what I prefer (however, for $1 more you can get \"lean\" pastrami).  The chicken liver was kind of meh\\'.  It didn\\'t really have any seasoning or chopped egg.  I only put a little bit on the sandwich.  The tomatoes and lettuce on the side had also seen better days.  The total cost of the meal NOT including a bottle of domestic beer was about $15, so it\\'s a little pricey compared to subway subs, but I believe a good value.  They cure all of their meats at their strip district location.  I was a bit confused with respect to the tipping aspect with this place.  You don\\'t really have a typical waitress situation.  You place your order at the counter, grab your own drinks and outside of bringing you your food you don\\'t see her again.  Some tipped nothing I noticed and some tipped little (5%).  I chose to tip almost as much as I would at a typical restaurant, but not quite 20%.  This was a great new discovery for me... and maybe, a new hangover cure.',\n",

This person DOES NOT understand Indian food. Chicken Tikka Masala (he tells me) is a dry dish. Huh? Only Chicken Curry has gravy he tells ne. I ask him if they have Rice Pullao. He says no -- we got brown rice and white Basmati rice. \\n\\nThe first thing that shocked me was how LITTLE quantity I got for 60 bucks worth of spending. My dog could eat this meal and be hungry. Chicken curry? Please bring a magnifying glass. I think I see some in the bottom of the container! ANY OTHER INDIAN restaurant in town would have given easily 4 times the amount for the same spend. This was pure and simple HIGHWAY ROBBERY.\\n\\nNow the taste of the Chicken Curry. Blaaaaah! It is like someone went to the supermarker and bought a paste and cooked in a hurry! The chapati was very ordinary. The biriyani was ok and after about four mothfulls it was pretty much gone. The veggie curry was very very ordinary. \\n\\nI should have known when I walked in and saw so many white faces eating there that this was an impostor. They tell you that if you walk into an Indian restaurant and see all white faces make an about turn and run the heck out. I did not.  My bad.\\n\\nTo think that I cheated on my other favorite Indian restaurants to give this impostor a try! Sheesh! If you just go a couple of miles east there is an authentic Indian restaurant named Indian Paradise just south of Frank Lloyd Wright on Hayden Blvd. There dishes are plentiful and great. They even have a wine menu! Yes, you will see many Indians eating there! My favorite though is the Delhi Palace on University Drive in Tempe. The very best in North Indian! Look it up and do a take out there and the charming people there stuff it with so much food you will have leftovers enough for 3-4 days! Want South Indian vegetarian? Try Udupi Cafe on Rural Road in Tempe. What a gem! \\n\\nTRY THIS IMPOSTOR AT YOUR OWN RISK. Your money is better spent elsewhere.',\n",

The fried rice (or as you will see on the menu \"fired rice\" was tasty as hell though and I cleaned shop on that plate.  Very cheap and fun atmosphere (I peeked and saw a room full of older Asian women gambling in a room in the back--so cute).

We got someone to do it and he even offered! The other flavors are pretty delicious and the 16 flavors are enough for 4 people (or more) to share.\\n\\nTake a picture with the Coke polar bear or buy a mini-glass Coke bottle to take home. The Coke shirts and home items were actually quite stylish with lots of fun graphics by well-known designers. Try a few shirts on in the fitting room shaped like a glass filled with Coke!\\n\\n\"If you prick me, do I not bleed Coca-Cola?\"',\n",

       " 'Really a 3.5-star place. Decent bar food, smoke free, and well located.  Lunch is very packed, so come before 11:30.\\n\\nThey have some interesting takes on classic barfood, but their burgers and fries are great.

       " \"Every time I've come here I have no clue where to look. I know my way around an auto store like I know my way around a vagina. So a big shout out to the helpful and friendly staff here. Most recently, Ricardo, came out outside in the 158 degree heat to put freon in our car. The bf Rickie observed outside while I, nestled in my leather bucket seat, felt the car grow cooler and cooler while listening to The Pussycat Dolls. I know. Ironic isn't it?\",\n",
       " 'What the....? I\\'ve never yelped house of tricks? For shame! Some of the best meals I\\'ve ever had in tempe were at this mill ave. legend.\\nDon\\'t be thrown by the \"mill ave.\" portion of my previous statement - it\\'s far enough back from the p.f. chang\\'s, cue clubs and fat tuesdays to keep the college crowd from interrupting your $34 filet with shouts of \"jaegerbombers!\" plus, the price point isn\\'t exactly student-friendly (which is why I rarely get to eat here).\\n\\nThat usually means I come here for special occasion meals like birthdays and promotions, which typically entails a bottle of wine, two entrees, an app and a dessert ($100 for two people, easy). But I have, on occasion, come for happy hour drinks at the outdoor, four-sided bar. The restaurant is made up of two early 20th century homes connected by a large\\nwooden deck and spacious patio. Most of the seating is outside, so in the hot or cold months take that into consideration. They have two fireplaces and plenty of heat lamps, but in January I still ate with my coat on. Not sure what sort of relief they have in the summer - though it is shaded by a canopy of trees and has plenty of flowers and greenery to keep you cool...ish.\\n\\nI\\'ve never been disappointed in the food. My sister swears their ahi tuna is the best she\\'s ever tasted (she orders it in any restaurant that offers it). and she must not be the only one because they always have it on the menu, which they otherwise change seasonally. I\\'m a steak girl myself, but the cold weather of my last visit prompted a short rib bourguignonne order, which was fantastic. Two people in our party did opt for the filet mignon served with coconut milk mashed potatoes (wha...??? Yummers!) and lovey-love-loved it.\\n\\nThe service can be spotty... the bar, host and wait staff was a little green for a Saturday night. bartenders were not rude, but... a tad sophomoric for a place that has $80 bottles of wine on the menu. Our hostess was nice enough to move our table closer to the firepit, but never brought the heat lamp she promised. The server seemed to be on his third night of serving ever - forgot an appetizer and was easily confused and in a hurry - probably waiting to get cut so he could head to a kegger. No one on the staff we interacted with was over the age of 20....seems odd for a fancier place like HoT. \\n\\nBut, for being the only place of this caliber I can think of in all of tempe, I\\'ll take it.',\n",
       " \"In terms of Korean food this is probably the best in town. The place is clean and the food is very tasty. The only downside is the price. Compared to LA the prices are ridiculous. My tip: get the seafood combo. It's enough for two and the only reasonably priced selection they have. (around 3o bucks). It even comes with Gae Jang (raw spicy marinated blue crab) and Galbi. If you want to have Mul Naeng Myun you better be prepared to pay 12 bucks. That's almost double the price that you pay for the same dish in LA. But the broth was the best I have ever had and I am a Mul Naeng Myun expert. It truly is delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Wow!  That's what I can say.  I have been to Italy 11 times and have eaten some amazing stuff that, sadly, you can't always find in the US.  I had my doubts when I sat down at the bar at Enoteca.  To my pleasant surprise; from the moment I sat down, I was greeted with a high level of customer service that didn't end until I stepped outside of the restaurant.  The grisini (Italian breadsticks) were authentic Italian (reminded me of Turino) and had the simple flavor to allow the other dishes to really shine.  The marinated figs were amazing.  I was so enticed by the server's description that I just had to have it.  My main entree of pasta with broccoli rabe and homemade sausage was so good that before I realized my platae was empty.  Great place!  It took me back to Italy for sure.  How about opening a restaurant in Southern California so I can go there more often?\",\n",

I think it's kind of expensive and they pretty serve the leftovers from Saturday night.\\n\\nI really like their steaks.  Those are pretty good.  Nothing else really stood out in my mind.  I think I would rather go to Timpone's (see my review) and pay the same price.  The only thing you just don't get is the as-nice-decor.\",\n",

Beer and eggs just didn't sound too good to me. \\n\\nMy fiancée and I ordered the beer flight of all 8 beers and the root beer along with an appetizer sampler. Over all none of the beers were that impressive. The stout was the only one I remember being pretty good, but the best one was their root beer. The price for the beer sampler was really good I think it was only $10. But my biggest problem with Granite was the service was terrible. I know it was Sunday morning / afternoon but there was only like six tables and two waitresses. \\n\\nIf you're a beer nut and have to try all the brewery's in Toronto then give Granite a try. Or if you're working at DraftFCB and looking for a lunch spot then Granite could work for you. But if you ask me just go to Mill Street and skip Granite. Granite Brewery isn't that great and pretty far from the downtown.\"]"
